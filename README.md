# crud_based_php_admin_role

This is a part of a project which I did in my Web Application Development Course. The project was to develop a basic e-learning application, with Admin, Student and Instructor role.

My part required to develop the admin page which gives him/her complete control of the application. That means he/she can add/edit/delete users, courses, departments, course content and change roles.

Admin can also enroll and uneroll a user from course by changing the enrollment status in the database. This site lacks front-end layout but all functionalities are working.

Please open the login.php file to begin. All changes to database connection to be done config.php and database.php file. 

This work is the extension of https://github.com/chapagain/crud-php-simple. 
Work on search bars is up next and is not functional at the moment.
